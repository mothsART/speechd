speech-dispatcher (0.8-2) experimental; urgency=low

 * Since speech-dispatcher 0.8 the user configuration is not searched
   and stored in ~/.speech-dispatcher/ but in ~/.config/speech-dispatcher.
   Unfortunately, upstream speech-dispatcher did not implement backward
   compatibility, and due to the complexity of doing that, neither did we.
   If you already have a working user configuration, we suggest to manually
   fix this by either moving the configuration files, making appropriate
   symlinks or running spd-conf to generate a fresh configuration.

 * During installation, you probably have speech-dispatcher already running.
   As I am unsure if it is wise to kill all running speech-dispatcher
   instancance during installation, I leave that up to the user for now.
   So you should restart your speech-dispatcher instance to make sure it
   uses the latest installed version. E.g. by running:
   $ killall speech-dispatcher
   and letting it automatically be restarted if you have the default of
   autospawning on. I can come up with scenarios where reverse dependencies
   of speech-dispatcher might not work until you do.

* Using Speech Dispatcher with Festival

It is recommended to run Speech Dispatcher with Festival, since Festival is the
speech synthesizer providing most functionality together with Speech
Dispatcher.  If you want to use Speech Dispatcher with Festival, please install
the speech-dispatcher-festival package and read its README.Debian.

* Using Speech Dispatcher with ALSA or OSS

When Speech Dispatcher is used with direct sound output to ALSA or OSS (on the
contrary to using a sound server, e.g. PulseAudio) and your audio device is not
set up to allow concurrent access, Speech Dispatcher may block all your audio
output.  For this reason the default Speech Dispatcher configuration comes with
PulseAudio as the only audio output.  If you don't want to use PulseAudio for
Speech Dispatcher audio output, change AudioOutputMethod option in your Speech
Dispatcher configuration (either /etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf or
~/.config/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf) accordingly and restart your Speech
Dispatcher processes.

* System wide startup (not recommended anymore)

If you want to run Speech Dispatcher as a system wide process, set RUN option
in /etc/default/speech-dispatcher to `yes', and set the SPEECHD_SOCKET environment
variable to /run/speech-dispatcher/speechd.sock before starting clients.

* Log file permissions

Please note all Speech Dispatcher log files can reveal your user interactions
and texts you read through Speech Dispatcher, among others.  For this reason,
the /var/log/speech-dispatcher/ directory is world-unreadable by default.
